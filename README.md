# MVA_Project
This is an academic project that is developed by students at UPC.edu

Project Statement:
Any data matrix contains information about the generating phenomenon. The practice will consist in choosing a real problem and applying multivariate techniques to reveal the hidden information contained in the data set, as a prior step to modeling. The problem can be chosen from the machine learning repository (UCI).

The student must perform a multivariate approach of the data matrix (visualization, clustering and interpretation) plus a prediction model suitable for the undertaken problem. The student must write a complete report upon the solution envisaged.
